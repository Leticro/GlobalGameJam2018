    "Well I guess now I don't get a zombie cat... I need to balance my spell cards so I don't make them too complex.",
    "If I limit myself to one Spell Card per zombie and maximum of 10 power points I shouldn't have too much trouble even at this range.",
    "Though as the abject failure Reginald's just demonstrated, they're not always going to listen to my commands anyway.",
    "I should also keep in mind that I can learn new spells as I go, and even use my zombies to create new Spell Cards from the deck screen.",
    "For now, let's try sending Reginald out into the Graveyard to do something!"
