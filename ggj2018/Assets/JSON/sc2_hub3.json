Unfortunately, your zombies are beginning to be pricked by arrows from the archers in the turrets nearby. Before you continue into the castle to carry out your most righteous quest, you should silence their pathetic bolts!

"A logical decision. However, your zombies are quickly cut down by the flurry of arrows coming down the staircase before they can get within range to explode! Even with your significant forces, the battle Is lost. Though one small victory is now the turret smells bad…",
"As your zombies allowed the spores to fester and draft upward in the wind up the turret, you begin to hear coughing from the top. Soon, the archers come tumbling down, their corpses scrambling back up to enlist in your burgeoning army!",
"As your corpses charge up the stairs, they’re quickly met with enemy fire. Unfortunately, at these distances, numbers are still no match for the hail of death. Conceivably, they could one day be taught to dodge…"
"Your zombies play dead. ‘Double tap’ shots rain from the tower, luckily missing zombie vitals. Quickly, the archers come to collect the trophies for their kills and end up joining your ranks of vile minions!",
"While a sound strategy, given enough time the zombies are entirely capable of filling the tower with vomit. Nevertheless, you do not think this is a wise idea in the short run... Nor do the archers who rain arrows upon your horde.",
"Your zombies retreat outside to go jump in the moat, as the only option available to them is to infect the water supply. The good news is the archers seem to be getting practice in spearfishing because of this... Though you may lose a few zombies because of it."
