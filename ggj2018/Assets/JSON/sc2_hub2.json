    "Sometimes if you do the same thing repeatedly, it ends up working and thankfully a catapult with a zombie in it will eventually succeed in any task. You managed to launch the zombie directly into the control mechanism, lowering the moat bridge! May your flying zombies contribute you to victory, Little Necromancer!",
    "Unfortunately, bridges are unable to become the walking dead... You should probably tell your zombies that so they stop standing next to it hoping to waft enough spores onto it. Reginald is too demoralized to continue fighting.",
    "Well, thankfully, teeth are highly effective in destroying mechanisms. I suppose the old adage of ‘percussive maintenance’ holds true even with zombies.",
    "The drawbridge seems receptive to the hugs, but unfortunately cannot be infected with affection, no matter how endearing… Emily leaves to pursue a pageant career…",
    "The water is already pretty infected. I'm not sure what your zombies expected to accomplish by vomiting into it but it doesn't seem to have the desired effect on the bridge... Mary refuses to come back to work unless you agree to sanitation guidelines…",
    "Your zombies appear to be taking a beach day because they float in the water idly. Additionally, I think a crocodile just ate Matt."
