Spices fill the air with a thick aroma and people shake on deals. The commotion should provide an ample veil for your vile misdeeds."],

"So far, exploding on the camel has produced diminishing returns, though it did make a zombie that is comparatively large. The guard quickly overwhelmed your hoard seeking to defend the remaining shopkeepers. Caveat emptor, my little Princess!",
"Your zombie climbs into a bucket of spices and with no one to tell the difference that sweet spice smell swiftly becomes a miasma of undeath! *Hub 2 Houses*",
"So apparently swords are a popular thing to sell! This is good news for the village but not so good news for the zombies, who are quickly eviscerated when they try to bite one of the guards…",
"Apparently having a zombie stand there and just try sampling the products means that the merchants touch them a lot so it didn't even need to accomplish anything and already the market is infected. Your army of merchants is ready to take on the castle... Or at least overthrow capitalism... *hub 2 Houses*",
"After they vomit on an apple cart, your zombies are quickly captured by the guards and confused for a gaggle of humble, filthy orphans. They are severely beaten for being poor…",
"You're not sure why the zombie climbed into a water barrel in the first place. Unfortunately, that one's going to a different city as well. So even though it did technically succeed, it is somewhat lessened in effect locally. This is why it's critical to purchase things locally, my Princess!"
