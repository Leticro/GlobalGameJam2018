# Global Game Jam 2018

Global Game Jam is a 48 hour event where various artists, designers, and programmers gather to develop a game in the
given 48 hour time frame. This year, the topic for the game was transmissions.

This game deals with the concept of Transmissions as communication relays and as disease vectors. You play a necromancer
determined to take over the kingdom of zombies who suffers from a lack of Direct Control. You must use cards with disease
vectors and emotions to indicate to the zombies how you want them to go about performing your bidding. The game is visual novel
styled to emphasize the strengths in storytelling and artwork.

This is my second year attending a Global Game Jam and planned to venture out into a new group as an independent programmer
for first time. I ended up paring with Shane McDermott for programming, a previous classmate in my game development classes at
University of Nebraska at Omaha. Mark Maiefski was the lead game designer/story writer. Kayla Swain is the lead artist that drew
all the beautiful assets in this game. Caimen Wight was the sound artist and the lead editor. Urio Harding is the assistant that
provided significant contributions in helping each one of us.

This source code runs on the Unity game engine. An executable file of the game can be downloaded from the link above.
